The full source code can be found at [biblio](https://github.com/RRethy/biblio/blob/master/biblio.go). All code will be in [Go](https://golang.org/).

## What is the Aho-Corasick Algorithm

The Aho-Corasick algorithm for string-searching will find where each pattern occurs in the text in linear time.
For patterns ["foo", "bar", "baz"] and text "barbinfoobaz", t
